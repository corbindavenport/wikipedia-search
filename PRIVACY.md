# Privacy Policy for Wikipedia Search

Wikipedia Search is committed to respecting your privacy and being transparent about the collected data. This policy outlines what information is transmitted during the installation and use of Wikipedia Search, how it is used, and how you can control the collection.

## Information collected by Wikipedia Search

Wikipedia Search stores your language selection and other settings in your web browser. That data may be synchronized to your other devices through your web browser's cloud account (e.g. a Firefox Account in Firefox). The extension itself does not transmit any other information about you or your device.

Wikipedia Search sends your search queries to the official Wikipedia APIs for auto-complete results. See the [Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Policy:Privacy_policy) for more information on using Wikipedia services.
